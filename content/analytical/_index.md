description: We are open to new collaborative projects and helping you with fee-for-service analyses.  We regularly work with other academics and those in industry.  We typically use UHPLC, UHPLC-MS/MS, and UHPLC-QTOF-MS to do quantitative analysis, compound ID/discovery, and metabolomics experiments.  If you are interested in working with us, please send Jess an email and she can provide additional information, including capability and pricing.
