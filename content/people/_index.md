    üçÖ a short CV <br>
    üçè a short paragraph on why you are interested in our group <br>
    üçì (for prospective grad students) what degree and program you're interested in <br>
    <br>**Prospective graduate students:**<br>Both Horticulture and Crop Science, and Food Science and Technology are direct admit programs (i.e., no rotations), so students will only be admitted once they have found a faculty adviser to support them (both financially and with mentorship) during their degree. For this reason, it's important to reach out before the application process!<br>
    <br>Students interested to start in the Summer or Fall should have completed applications by Nov 30 of the previous year. Most discussions with prospective students occur in Summer/early Fall.<br>
    <br>If you have any questions about the application process, please reach out to Jess via email."
