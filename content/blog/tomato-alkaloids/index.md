We are working to understand the profile and concentrations of tomato alkaloids across germplasm, their genetic control in fruits, and their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and health impact in those who enjoy tomatoes.

Here is some work we've published on the topic:

- Dzakovich MP, Francis DM, Cooperstone JL. [Biosynthesis of steroidal alkaloids are coordinately regulated and differ among tomatoes in the red-fruited clade](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.425594).  bioRxiv, 2021,

-- Also published a [pre-print](https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.23.878223) on bioRxiv
