In order to understand what phytochemicals are doing within a system, robust and quantitative methods are required for their analysis.  We focus on developing liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry based methods to allow analysis of phytochemicals and their metabolites, often present at picomolar concentrations. Some papers here are also included which use our methods.

Here is some work we've published on the topic:<br>
