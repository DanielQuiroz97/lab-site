Apples are the most consumed fruit in the US and both anectdotally and actually keep the doctor away.  But apple breeding is challenged by many factors.  We are working to aid the process of breeding healthier apples by better understanding apple genome-metabolite relationships.

Here is some work we've published on the topic:

- Bilbrey EA, Williamson K, Hatzakis E, Doud Miller D, Fresnedo Ram√≠rez J, Cooperstone JL. [Integrating genomics and multi-platform metabolomics enables metabolite QTL detection in breeding-relevant apple germplasm](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17693). New Phytologist, 2021. 
-- Also published a [pre-print](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.18.431481) on bioRxiv

If you have trouble accessing any work, send Jess an email and she'd be happy to share the paper and its relevant data with you.
