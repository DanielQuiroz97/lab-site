      <title>Tomato steroidal alkaloids</title>

      <description>We are working to understand the profile and concentrations of tomato alkaloids across germplasm, their genetic control in fruits, and their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and health impact in those who enjoy tomatoes.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:
 Dzakovich MP, Francis DM, Cooperstone JL. Biosynthesis of steroidal alkaloids are coordinately regulated and differ among tomatoes in the red-fruited clade. bioRxiv, 2021, Dzakovich MP, Hartman JL, Cooperstone JL.</description>

      <title>Apple genome-metabolome integration</title>

      <description>Apples are the most consumed fruit in the US and both anectdotally and actually keep the doctor away. But apple breeding is challenged by many factors. We are working to aid the process of breeding healthier apples by better understanding apple genome-metabolite relationships.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:
 Bilbrey EA, Williamson K, Hatzakis E, Doud Miller D, Fresnedo Ramírez J, Cooperstone JL. Integrating genomics and multi-platform metabolomics enables metabolite QTL detection in breeding-relevant apple germplasm.</description>

      <description>Metabolomics allows the comprehensive profiling of hundreds to thousands of small molecules present within a system. By using this approach, we can understand how metabolic changes (in plants, cells, animals, or people) are affected by our research question, and generate new ideas we may not be able to a priori hypothesize.

      <title>Phytochemical analysis</title>

      <description>In order to understand what phytochemicals are doing within a system, robust and quantitative methods are required for their analysis. We focus on developing liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry based methods to allow analysis of phytochemicals and their metabolites, often present at picomolar concentrations.

      <title>Nutrition interventions with fruits and vegetables</title>

      <description>To determine the in vivo health impacts of fruits and vegetables and their constituent phytochemicals, we conduct studies in animals and humans. We look to understand absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and effect on development of disease.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:
In humans:  Cooperstone JL, Novotny JA, Riedl KM, Cichon MJ, Francis DM, Curley Jr. RW, Schwartz SJ, Harrison EH. Limited appearance of apocarotenoids is observed in plasma after consumption of tomato juices, a randomized human clinical trial.</description>
