      <description>Metabolomics allows the comprehensive profiling of hundreds to thousands of small molecules present within a system. By using this approach, we can understand how metabolic changes (in plants, cells, animals, or people) are affected by our research question, and generate new ideas we may not be able to a priori hypothesize.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:

      <description>To determine the in vivo health impacts of fruits and vegetables and their constituent phytochemicals, we conduct studies in animals and humans. We look to understand absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and effect on development of disease.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:
In humans:  Thomas M, Puglisi M, Malysheva O, Caudill M, Sholola MJ, Cooperstone JL, Fernandez ML. Eggs improve plasma biomarkers in patients with metabolic syndrome following a plant-based diet.</description>
