      <description>Metabolomics allows the comprehensive profiling of hundreds to thousands of small molecules present within a system. By using this approach, we can understand how metabolic changes (in plants, cells, animals, or people) are affected by our research question, and generate new ideas we may not be able to a priori hypothesize.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:

      <description>In order to understand what phytochemicals are doing within a system, robust and quantitative methods are required for their analysis. We focus on developing liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry based methods to allow analysis of phytochemicals and their metabolites, often present at picomolar concentrations. Some papers here are also included which use our methods.

      <description>To determine the in vivo health impacts of fruits and vegetables and their constituent phytochemicals, we conduct studies in animals and humans. We look to understand absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and effect on development of disease.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:
In humans:  Thomas M, Puglisi M, Malysheva O, Caudill M, Sholola MJ, Cooperstone JL, Fernandez ML. Eggs improve plasma biomarkers in patients with metabolic syndrome following a plant-based diet.</description>

      <description>We are working to understand the profile and concentrations of tomato alkaloids across germplasm, their genetic control in fruits, and their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and health impact in those who enjoy tomatoes.
Here is some work we&amp;rsquo;ve published on the topic:
 Dzakovich MP, Goggans ML, Thomas-Ahner JM, Moran NE, Clinton SK, Francis DM, Cooperstone JL. Transcriptomics and metabolomics reveal tomato consumption alters hepatic xenobiotic metabolism and induces steroidal alkaloid metabolite accumulation in mice.</description>
